# What is `tutomd`?

`tutomd` is a command-line tool capable of generating structured tutorials, just like this one you are reading, out of Markdown files.

The output generated by `tutomd` is highly inspired by the tutorials from Unity Learn platform. ([See one example](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/about-unity-visual-scripting))

# The "article" page

Article pages are just like the one you're seeing right now. They're broken down to the following sections:

- **Summary**: A highlighted section with a header image (optional) and an overview on what the reader will learn by the end of the article.
- **Multiple steps (actionable or not)**: Each step can be checked as "complete" by the reader.

The last "step" encourages the reader to continue reading through to the next articles. This last step is generated automatically.

# The "index" page

The index page is optional, and can contain an overview of a combination of multiple articles, followed by a link to each separate article.
