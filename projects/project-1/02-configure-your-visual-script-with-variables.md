# Configure your visual script with variables

Variables are essential programming tools. With them, you can store, calculate, and manipulate the input values to the units of your scripts.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use Visual Scripting to create and manage several kinds of variables that have different scopes and uses. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to:

- Create Graph, Object, and Scene variables and explain their uses
- Add Get Variable units to a Graph using the Blackboard
- Make variables available to be changed in the Inspector window
- Troubleshoot adjusting variable values in Scene and Game views
- Explain the Scene Variables object that appears in the Hierarchy of projects with Visual Scripts

# Overview

**Variables** are values that can, well, vary. Instead of coding inline values directly into your script as you did in the previous tutorial, you can represent them with names and manipulate their values in the script.

**Note to experienced C# scripters:** Visual Scripting gives you new and different ways to manage variables. Please follow this tutorial to learn how.

# Create a variable in the Blackboard

The Blackboard is the place to organize several types of variables. For this tutorial, we will only use variables that pertain to this Graph, your cube GameObject, and this Scene. However, variables can also apply to your entire project.
